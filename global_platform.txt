Gemini Global Platform:

To establish Gemini as a global platform, we identified the problems with the existing workflow and resolved them one by one.
1. Migration of Gemini to PostgreSQL and Off Hazelcast to Ensure:
2. The shipment object is not locked by a single user.
3. Concurrent users can work on the same shipment.
4. Bulk updates can be performed.

Each country has its own set of rules and additional data. To support every country, we developed an Excel-based metamodel where we defined all the attributes and database details. we consume the Metamodel and created a Data Access Layer 
GEMINI's Data Access Layer (DAL). DAL helps access and update GEMINI business data in a way that it is easy to manage global, regional, and country-specific details in a universal, and language-agnostic manner so that data can be treated consistently across Java code, business rules, and JavaScript runtimes.


Roles and Responsibilities:

1. Developed custom queries to interact with the Data Access Layer (DAL).
2. Constructed major components within the DAL, including the query parser, query builder, runner, and hydrator for query fetch operations.
3. Formulated the logic for Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations.
4. Developed a Command-Line Interface (CLI) to interact with the DAL.
5. Enhanced the DAL to validate the MetaModel Excel.
6. Expanded the DAL to support bulk update operations.
7. Successfully integrated consumer services with DAL using FeignClient.
8. Created a utility to convert Excel into Data Definition Language (DDL) scripts.
9. Developed a utility for synthetic data generation (faker data for performance testing).
10. Participated in the implementation process of materialized views and control tables.
11. Enhanced the DAL to support the GCC platform.
12. Acquired proficiency in Azure deployment and monitoring using Azure CLI.
13. Gained substantial knowledge of PostgreSQL and the pgAdmin management tool.
